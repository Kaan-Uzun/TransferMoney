# TransferMoney
Jr BE Engineer_Spring Boot Rest Exercise

First of all, I have taken a decision to work with multitier layered.

Then decided to work with Sqlite for the Database as Embedded DB.

After I have decided to use Interfaces to apply for SOLID Principles(Dependency).

I followed the project in line with all the steps that I pushed to GitHub.

- to create Account Class and IEntity
  // to apply SOLID Principles for all entity classes
- to create DataAccess Layer and AccountDal(Data Access Layer)
- to create a new Layer to Manage all Result
- to create Business Layer and AccountService Interface
- Added AccountManager in Business Layer 
- Added Embedded DB(Sqlite) and Minor Fix for AccountManager
- to create RestAPI Layer and Controller for Account
- to create a MoneyTransferDto, TransferMoney Method and Accesing an Api to get instantaneous change of currency to correct money transfer
- Added Unit Test
- Minor Fix AccountController
- Added Import For Dto(Data Transfer Object)

I have also tried to add some comments between the code blocks to explain it better.
